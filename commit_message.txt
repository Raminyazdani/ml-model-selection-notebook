Ramin Yazdani | ML Model Selection Notebook | main | WIP(data): Start notebook with synthetic data generation

Create the main Jupyter notebook and implement synthetic dataset generation for classification tasks.

This commit initializes the analysis notebook with:
- Project title and overview
- Import statements for core libraries (numpy, matplotlib, sklearn)
- Synthetic circular dataset generation using sklearn's make_circles
- Data visualization with scatter plots

The make_circles dataset is chosen because:
- Creates non-linearly separable data (concentric circles)
- Perfect for demonstrating when linear models fail
- Ideal for comparing linear vs. non-linear classifiers
- Visually clear and easy to understand

This establishes the foundation for all subsequent machine learning analysis. Starting with data generation before implementing algorithms follows best practices for ML workflow development.

Files added/modified:
- ml_model_selection_analysis.ipynb - Created with cells 0-6

Verification: Notebook runs successfully, generates circular dataset, and produces clear visualization. Dataset has expected shape and distribution for classification demonstrations.
