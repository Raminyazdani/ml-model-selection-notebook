Ramin Yazdani | ML Model Selection Notebook | main | WIP(models): Add classification models for comparison

Set up three classification algorithms for comparison: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.

This commit introduces:
- Model fitting section header
- Import statements for three classifiers
- Model instantiation code

Models chosen for comparison:
- Logistic Regression: Linear decision boundary, widely used baseline
- Linear Discriminant Analysis: Assumes Gaussian distributions with shared covariance
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis: Allows for quadratic decision boundaries

These three models provide good coverage of classification approaches from linear to quadratic, perfect for demonstrating how model choice affects performance on non-linear data.

NOTE: This commit contains a bug in the import path (using sklearn.discriminant instead of sklearn.discriminant_analysis). This is a realistic mistake that will be fixed in the next commit after testing reveals the error.

Files modified:
- ml_model_selection_analysis.ipynb - Extended to cells 0-11

Verification: Code written but not yet tested (import error will be discovered upon execution).
