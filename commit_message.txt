Ramin Yazdani | ML Model Selection Notebook | main | feat(fix): Final completion - Fix syntax errors from TODO removal

Perform final end-to-end quality pass and fix critical syntax errors that prevented notebook execution.

Problem discovered:
During the previous portfolio cleanup (step 13), TODO comments were removed from code cells, but the removal process inadvertently corrupted inline comments. The cleanup changed "# TODO: comment" to ": comment" or removed line breaks, creating invalid Python syntax that prevented the notebook from executing.

Specific issues fixed:
1. Restored proper # comment syntax in kfold_cross_validation function (cell 9)
2. Fixed inline comments in model instantiation code (cell 11)
3. Corrected comment syntax in K-values evaluation loop (cell 13)
4. Fixed comments in classification, regression, and non-linear model cells
5. Restored proper line breaks between statements that were incorrectly merged

Solution approach:
- Referenced the original assignment_3_handout.ipynb to restore proper code structure
- Removed "TODO" text while preserving the # comment markers
- Maintained all functional code and analysis content
- Ensured all code cells compile and execute successfully

Verification performed:
- Installed dependencies: numpy, matplotlib, jupyter, scikit-learn
- Executed full notebook with: jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook
- Result: All 37 cells execute successfully without syntax errors
- Output: 1.7MB notebook with all visualizations and results
- All imports work correctly
- All machine learning analyses run to completion

This represents the final working state of the project:
- All code is syntactically correct and executable
- All portfolio documentation is complete and professional
- All assignment traces removed while maintaining technical quality
- Project is fully reproducible from requirements.txt
- Notebook demonstrates all intended ML techniques successfully

The project is now complete and ready for portfolio presentation. It showcases:
- Custom K-fold cross-validation implementation
- Classification model comparison (Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA)
- Decision boundary visualization
- Regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso)
- Non-linear regression (Polynomial and Spline)
- Professional documentation and code quality

Files in final state:
- ml_model_selection_analysis.ipynb - Fully working analysis notebook
- assignment_3_handout.ipynb - Original reference
- README.md - Portfolio-grade documentation
- project_identity.md - Professional project identity
- requirements.txt - Complete dependency list
- .gitignore - Proper version control exclusions

Status: PROJECT COMPLETE AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL
