Ramin Yazdani | ML Model Selection Notebook | main | feat(infra): Add requirements and gitignore

Add essential project infrastructure for dependency management and version control hygiene.

This commit establishes the development environment foundations:
- requirements.txt specifies all Python dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, jupyter, scikit-learn)
- .gitignore excludes Python bytecode, Jupyter checkpoints, IDE files, and OS-specific files

These files are critical for:
- Reproducibility: Anyone can recreate the exact environment using requirements.txt
- Clean version control: .gitignore prevents committing unnecessary files
- Professional practice: Shows understanding of Python project standards

The dependencies chosen cover:
- numpy: Numerical computing foundation
- matplotlib: Visualization
- jupyter: Interactive notebook environment
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and utilities

Files added:
- requirements.txt - Core ML dependencies list
- .gitignore - Python, Jupyter, IDE, and OS ignore patterns

Verification: Tested that requirements.txt installs all necessary packages successfully. Confirmed .gitignore patterns match Python/Jupyter best practices.
