Ramin Yazdani | ML Model Selection Notebook | main | feat(nonlinear): Add spline regression and assignment reference

Complete the non-linear techniques section with spline regression and include the original assignment for reference.

This commit adds:
- Spline transformer implementation using sklearn's SplineTransformer
- B-spline regression with varying numbers of knots (2, 3, 4, 10)
- Varying spline degrees (2, 3, 10)
- Complex model exploration demonstrating flexible non-linear modeling
- Original assignment notebook (assignment_3_handout.ipynb) for context

Spline regression advantages:
- More flexible than polynomial regression
- Local control via knots (changes in one region don't affect others)
- Avoids high-degree polynomial instability
- Smooth continuous functions
- Better extrapolation behavior

Configuration space explored:
- Knots: Control number of piecewise regions (2, 3, 4, 10)
- Degree: Control smoothness of splines (2=quadratic, 3=cubic, 10=very smooth)
- Shows how different configurations affect fit

Why include original assignment:
- Maintains transparency about educational origins
- Provides context for portfolio reviewers
- Shows progression from course work to polished project
- Demonstrates ability to transform educational work into professional portfolio pieces

This completes the core technical content:
- Part 1: Generalization (K-fold CV)
- Part 2: Model Selection (Classification models)
- Part 3: Beyond Linearity (Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial, Splines)

Files modified/added:
- ml_model_selection_analysis.ipynb - Extended to cells 0-36 (complete analysis)
- assignment_3_handout.ipynb - Original assignment file added

Verification: Spline regression implemented successfully with all knot and degree configurations. Visualizations show expected flexible non-linear fits. Original assignment preserved correctly for reference.
