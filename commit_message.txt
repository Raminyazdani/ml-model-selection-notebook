Ramin Yazdani | ML Model Selection Notebook | main | feat(models): Fix sklearn import path for discriminant analysis

Correct the import error from the previous commit by fixing the module path.

Bug fixed:
- Changed: from sklearn.discriminant import ...
- To: from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import ...

This was discovered when attempting to run the notebook after the previous commit. Python raised an ImportError stating "No module named 'sklearn.discriminant'". The correct module name is sklearn.discriminant_analysis, not sklearn.discriminant.

This is a realistic mistake that happens when working from memory with sklearn's nested module structure. The discriminant_analysis module contains both LinearDiscriminantAnalysis and QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis classes, but the module name is easy to misremember.

After this fix:
- All three models (Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA) are properly instantiated
- Import statements work correctly
- Models are ready for training and evaluation

Files modified:
- ml_model_selection_analysis.ipynb - Fixed import in cell 11

Verification: Notebook now runs without import errors. All three classifiers can be successfully instantiated and are ready for use in the evaluation pipeline.
