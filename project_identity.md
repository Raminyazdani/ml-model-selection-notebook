### Tagline
A comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating machine learning model selection, cross-validation, and evaluation techniques from linear to non-linear models.

### GitHub Description
An educational ML project showcasing model selection workflows including custom K-fold cross-validation, comparison of classification and regression models, regularization techniques, and decision boundary visualization.

- regression
- classification
- regularization
- model-evaluation
- python

### What Problem It Solves
This project addresses the fundamental challenge of selecting and evaluating appropriate machine learning models for classification and regression tasks. It demonstrates practical techniques for:
- Implementing cross-validation from scratch to assess model generalization
- Comparing multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA)
- Applying regularization to prevent overfitting (Ridge, Lasso)
- Exploring non-linear models (Polynomial and Spline regression)
- Visualizing decision boundaries and model performance

### Approach
The project uses a hands-on, code-driven approach with three main parts:
1. **Generalization**: Custom K-fold cross-validation implementation
2. **Model Selection**: Systematic comparison of classification algorithms
3. **Beyond Linearity**: Exploration of regularization and non-linear regression techniques

All techniques are implemented in a single Jupyter notebook with extensive visualizations and practical examples using synthetic datasets.

### Inputs
- Synthetic datasets generated using scikit-learn's `make_classification` and `make_circles`
- Configurable model parameters and hyperparameters
- User-defined K-fold values and regularization parameters

### Outputs
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, MSE)
- Decision boundary visualizations
- Cross-validation performance plots
- Comparison charts for different models and hyperparameters
- All outputs are displayed inline within the notebook
